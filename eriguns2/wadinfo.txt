Description             : The second Eriguns pack, featuring a devilish
                          array of demonic weaponry, adapted from
                          Amuscaria's "Hell-Forged". Bored with shotguns
                          and rocket launchers? Try out some fleshrippers,
                          soulthrowers, and bloodletters for a change.

                          This mod features thirteen new weapons, hand-
                          drawn by one of the best Doom artists in the
                          "business", all with a demonic theme that feels
                          right at home in Doom, Heretic, _and_ Hexen.

Additional Credits to   : Amuscaria (née Eriance) for the kickass weapon
                          sprites, plus many others -- see Credits section.

* Gameplay Notes *

Unlike its counterpart, Eriguns #2 is a full weapon overhaul, behavior and
all. Not all weapon replacements are going to behave identically to their
replaced counterparts (e.g. the SSG replacement is effectively a rocket
launcher); ammo balance should be preserved, however, but be warned that
it's a bit of an unusual mix on the surface.

In order to best support Doom, Heretic, and Hexen, weapons exhibit some
differences between the games (mainly ammo types; in Heretic, there are a
few new unique ammo types for some guns, and in Hexen, weapons use mana).
In addition, some items only appear in certain games -- Soul Bombs, for
instance, replace Flechettes and Time Bombs, but don't make an appearance
in Doom.

For a full list of what devilish delights await (or whatever cheesy
phrase you prefer), read on!

===========================================================================
* Weapons *

Hell has an interesting way with weapon smithery. Not only are these
biomechanical pseudo-magical death dealers extremely effective in their
own right, but they all sport a secondary function that's activated when
an external surge of demonic power... ok, look, they all have powered-up
modes and the berserk pack is a Tome of Power. 'Nuff said, y'all.

That over with, let's get to the nitty gritty...

Templar Sword
-------------
  Your starting weapon. Also your ending weapon if you don't find something
  better, quick.

  Powered up, however, the runes on its surface glow with a powerful
  counter-curse that steals the life-force of those it cuts and transfers
  it to the wielder -- that's you -- resulting in a nice friendly health
  boost. Good in a pinch, though be warned you've got to get in close
  to use it, so those beasties are liable to pinch you right back.

Vorpal Blade
------------
  [TODO: desc]

Immolator
---------
  A pocket-sized flamethrower, perfect for lighting cigars and melting
  faces. Flames stick to enemies for a short while, and when powered up,
  this puppy shoots a continuous stream of flame that makes short work
  of flammable foes. Marshmallows not included.

Super Immolator
---------------
  [TODO: desc]

Bloodbane
---------
  [TODO: desc]

Nailgun
-------
  A landmark in efficient design, this compact spike-thrower doubles
  as both a machinegun and a torture device... and maybe an industrial
  tool, if you're building something out of solid titanium and
  need the punch.

  Nails have a tendency to rip through their targets, and when powered,
  the projectiles become super-heated and cleave through just about
  anything with a pulse. Hope you weren't too attached to your neighbors.

Mauler
------
  What's better than a nail machinegun? How about strapping a cluster of
  them together, modifying the firing mechanism, and brandishing a
  shiny new nail supershotgun?

  Whether you're turning enemies into instant pincushions or powering
  this baby up and unleashing a volley of volatile energy at a crowd of
  foes, this little horror is proof that sometimes too much of a good
  thing can, in fact, be a great thing.

Irebolt
-------
  [TODO: desc]

Hellforge
---------
  [TODO: desc]

Soulcaster
----------
  [TODO: desc]

Basilisk
--------
  [TODO: desc]

Hydra
-----
  [TODO: desc]

Soul Reaver
-----------
  [TODO: desc]

* Artifacts *

Guns ain't everything. Most of doom's earthly items, like medical kits and
radiation suits, have been replaced with more Hell-esque counterparts
(magical floaty spheres, mostly), and a few new creations grace the screen:

- Hellsphere:
Jam-packed with violence, deapsir, and other juicy emotional distress,
consuming this horrifying artifact will fill the user with strength and
rage, powering up their weapons for a limited time and buffing one's melee
prowess for the duration of the level. Two for the price of one!

- Demonomicon:
The Essence of the Hellsphere, condensed into a convenient written form.
The cursed glyphs within can only be read once, but will fill the user
with a surge of demonic energy. Totally not just a Tome of Power or anything.

- Soul Bomb:
A volatile cask of spiritual energy, these bombs erupt violently after a
few seconds and deal tremendous Soul damage to all enemies within range,
rupturing victims' souls and potentially causing a ghastly chain reaction.

- Dark Armor:
Exclusive to Hexen, this four-piece set of hell-forged armor is tempered
in hellfire, giving it extreme resilience against all forms of damage.
Each piece grants 50 points of armor, which can stack to a whopping 200
points of full damage reduction when donning the full set.
