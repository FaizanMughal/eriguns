Description             : The first Eriguns pack, featuring a spiffy set
                          of updated UAC military armaments. It's the Doom
                          weapons you know and love, but with a fresh coat
                          of paint, adapted from Amuscaria's "Demon Eclipse".

                          This mod offers two modes of play: Standard mode
                          sticks to the vanilla weapon behaviors, while
                          Alternate mode adds some new guns and adds a few
                          interesting twists to the stock ones. Who says
                          you can't teach an old gun new tricks?

Additional Credits to   : Amuscaria (née Eriance) for the kickass weapon
                          sprites, plus many others -- see Credits section.

* Gameplay Notes *

At its core, Eriguns #1 is mainly an aesthetic tune-up of Doom's classic
weapons. Though the designs are different, the guns are still the same at
heart: super shotguns, rocket launchers, and plasma rifles.

In fact, to hammer home this point, there's two "rule sets" to choose from
when starting a new game:
 - Standard: weapons behave exactly the same as their Doom counterparts.
 - Alternate: some weapons are tweaked a bit, and there's a few new guns.

As mentioned, the Standard set plays exactly like good ol' Doom, so it's
perfect for folks just looking for a fresh coat of paint. For the more
adventurous, the Alternate set makes the following changes:
 - The Pistol is semi-automatic, fires faster, and has a 12-round magazine.
 - The Super Shotgun has two fire-modes: the primary fire shoots a single
   barrel at a time, while altfire unleashes both at once. If you've fired
   just one barrel, you can also reload the barrel without firing a second
   shot, if you so desire.
 - Two new weapons have been added:
   - Gatling Gun (slot 4): Dropped by Spider Masterminds. Fires twice
     as fast as the Machinegun (the chaingun-equivalent), but has a short
     spin-up/spin-down time to compensate. Eats crowds for dinner.
   - Missile Launcher (slot 5): Dropped by Cyberdemons. Works like ROTT's
     Split Missile; fire a pair of missiles with primary fire, then hit
     alt-fire to make 'em split in half and seek out targets. Tacticool!

There are also two additional weapons, currently only available via cheats:
 - Auto Shotgun (slot 3): Automatic. Twelve-round magazine. 'Nuff said.
 - Grenade Launcher (slot 8): Projectiles have gravity and don't bounce,
   but the explosion radius is twice the size of a rocket. Uses its own
   ammo type.

Although the above weapons don't appear ingame without cheats, they can
be placed into maps with the following DoomEdNums:
 - 1006: Auto Shotgun
 - 5011: Missile Launcher
 - 5012: Grenade Launcher
 - 5013: Grenades
 - 5014: Gatling Gun
 - 5015: Box of Grenades

...just in the off chance anyone ever wishes to map for this. :P
